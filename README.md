These are my dotfiles. Each folder is a module that can be linked using the given `stowscript.sh` and unlinked using the `unstowscript.sh`. 

Each module can contain a `stow` folder which can contain `preinit`, `init`, and `del` which are called 
before a stow occurs, after a stow occurs, and before an unstow occurs for that module, respectively.

Still a WIP.
